Rotation Measure
----------------

An FRB propogating through a magnetised cold-plasma will undergo a phenomena known as Faraday rotation, where the Linear polarisation position
angle is rotated due to the magnetic field parallel/anti-parallel to the FRB line of sight. This is usually quantified using the Rotation Measure.
The rotation measures for a cold plasma is well described by the following equation

.. math::
   \chi(\nu) = \mathrm{RMc^{2}}\Bigg(\frac{1}{\nu^{2}} - \frac{1}{\nu_{0}^{2}})

where :math:`RM` is the rotation measure, :math:`\chi` is the Linear polarisation position angle and :math:`\nu_{0}` the reference frequency.
