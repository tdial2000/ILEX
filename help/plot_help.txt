HOW DOES PLOTTING WORK?
-----------------------

Plotting in ILEX is standardised for ease of implementation and use. 
All plotting functions unless otherwise specified in their docstrings 
will follow this input/output format:

Inputs:

    dat: dict(ndarray)
         Dictionary of data used for plotting, the doc string of each function will
         specify what data is needed for this. For example (["I", "U"]). The function
         will also check if corrosponding errors have been given. For example (["Ierr", "Uerr"]).

    ax: Axes handle
        Handle to axes of matplotlib figure. If not given an seperate figure will be created.

    filename: str
              If a filename is given, then a figure of this plot will be saved with the given
              string.

    **kwargs: other
              Additional arguments will be avaliable depending on the plotting function.



Outputs:

    fig: figure handle
         If a new figure handle is created, it will be returned.

    Misc.: other
           Additional outputs will depend on the plotting function.



The basic workflow of each plotting function is as follows:


def _plot():

    1. check if ax handle is given, if not make figure

    2. get data from data dictionary, i.e. dat["I"]

    3. check if errors are given

    4. plot

    5. if filename given, save figure to .png file
